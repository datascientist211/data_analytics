    "In the Netherlands children go to primary school on the next day after they turn 4 years old. And before that, when they are 2.5 or 3 year old, their parents should choose a school for them. Ideally â€“ the best school for their baby. It's quite a big problem for a non-native dutch parent like myself. I have no idea what is important, what should I think about, what should I look at in this process. \n",
    "I found that Dutch Ministry of education, culture and science opened some data about primary schools. So I want to make a dataset out of the information from their recources and make some data analysis to understand better the dutch system of primary education.\n",
