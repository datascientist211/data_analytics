# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

During my study for [IBM Data Science Specialization Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/X5EYE97D56VG) I was going through a data collecting, analyses and developing models for prediction if first stage of Falcon 9 will sucessfully landed. 
Here you can see this steps:

1. [Collecting data using REST API](./jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.html)
2. [Collecting data using webscrapping](./jupyter-labs-webscraping.html)
3. [Data wrangling](./labs-jupyter-spacex-Data-wrangling.html)
4. [Exploratory Data Analysis](./jupyter-labs-eda-dataviz.html)
5. [Execute SQL queries to answer questions in data](./jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera.html)
4. [Launch sites locations analysis with Folium (using map)](./lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.html)
